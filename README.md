### What is ParkMe?
ParkMe is an automated parking-meter platform. A camera in each parking spot recognizes a car's license plate, and automatically charges the associated account based on the amount of time the car stays in the parking spot.

The "smart parking meter" runs on a Raspberry Pi, and can transmit license plate/timestamp data to a centralized server via WiFi. These parking meters are also portable, as the raspberry pi can be connected to an LTE endpoint. In this way, users can buy a fairly cheap meter and convert part of their own property into a paid parking spot. (This can be used, for example, on a football gameday where parking near a stadium may be scarce.) This repository contains a proof-of-concept demo of the parking meter communicating with the server over LTE, using the Particle Boron IoT platform.
