What ParkMe has implemented currently:
* Recognition of license plates
* Communication to our central server over WiFi
* Communication to our central server over LTE using Particle Boron IoT Platform
* Implementation on Raspberry Pi as detection endpoint

Contributions we're looking for:
* More stable LTE performance
* Compatibility with upcoming 5GE and 5G standards
* Compatibility with more endpoints and cameras, rather than just Raspberry Pi
* Video feed monitoring for security

If you would like to improve one of our current features or add new ones, you can fork this repository and create a pull request with your code. Once we get a pull request, we'll discuss the new code with you before merging it to our repository. Feel free to contact us about any ideas as well (see "Contact Us" above).
